  title="Enslavement at the Cape of Good Hope"
  firstSection={true}
>
  From the earliest Dutch settlement in 1652 to emancipation in the 1830s,
  enslaved persons provided the backbone of the colonial labor force. Some
  60,000 souls were forcibly brought to the Cape from Dutch settlements and
  ports throughout the Indian Ocean World: the Indonesian archipelago; Bengal
  and Sri Lanka; Madagascar; Mozambique and the east African coast. Historical
  sources reflect the perspective of the colonizers, providing little insight
  into the lives of individuals. The legal documents presented in this website
  are drawn from 87 criminal cases, all involving enslaved persons. In a few
  instances, owners are accused and convicted of mistreating the enslaved. All
  are drawn from the records of the Council of Justice. These documents provide
  a rich dossier of individual experiences.

<LandingPageSection title="How to use this resource">
  This website allows you to explore the stories of enslaved individuals. 87
  legal cases are presented in chronological order, from 1704 to 1794, each
  identified by the name of the accused. Each begins with a summary, followed by
  the trial document(s) in English translation with the Dutch original
  alongside, and accompanied by a map. Footnotes provide detailed explanation
  with references, while fuller context is available under the Histories tab.
  You may find recurrent themes (e.g. ‘arson’, ‘theft’) via the tags attached to
  individual cases or via the Search tab.
