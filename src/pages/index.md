<h2 class="page-heading">Description of project and scope of website</h2>

The main aim of Trials of Slavery is to present court documents from the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa), 1705-1794, all relating to enslavement, so as to provide otherwise unavailable histories of enslavement. There are a total of 87 trials at present, ranging in length from 1 printed book page to 25, though most are 6-10 pages in length. We have both English translations (annotated with notes) and original Dutch versions transcribed and would like them presented in tandem or at least in immediate proximity. Unlike the Louisiana Slave Conspiracies website, we do not envisage providing images of the original documents, so this suggests bipartite rather than tripartite presentation of texts.

Trials of Slavery is intended to be part - and the major part, at least initially - of the Early Cape Portal. Other elements of the Early Cape Portal will address visual history (video installations on selected themes); historical maps; musical traditions rooted in Cape slavery; modern narrative reconstructions.
